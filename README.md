# Single-Page-CV
**Project Goal:** 
<BR>The goal of this project was to create a structured, single-page CV using only HTML. You will focus on laying out your education, skills, and career history in a clean, semantic manner. Styling will be addressed in a later project. _(However i thought it looked a bit blanned so i added in some very basic styling)_

<BR>This is created for: https://roadmap.sh/projects/single-page-cv
